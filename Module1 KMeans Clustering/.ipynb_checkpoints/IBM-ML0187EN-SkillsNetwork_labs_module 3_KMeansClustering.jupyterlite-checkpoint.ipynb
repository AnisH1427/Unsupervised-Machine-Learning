By (legally) gathering information about you and your purchasing habits, corporations are able to group you with other customers that have similar characteristics. K Means clustering is one such algorithm that can categorize similar people! Then, companies can determine this population's potential preferences and personalize your experience with the brand, which ranges from product recommendations to email marketing content. \n",
